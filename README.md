Hypersphere is a high immersion VR game for the HTC Vive. The player starts on a platform and can grab and throw the game ball. The game objective for each level is to get the ball from the platform to the target. Once the ball is in free fall and has left the player's grasp, it has to move through a series of game objects like platforms and tractor beams to get to the target. The conditions to beat each level are:

1. The ball must be thrown from the platform.

2. The ball cannot hit the floor at any time after it has been released.

3. The ball must hit each orb along the path to be valid to hit the target to win.

4. The ball must hit the target.

If the ball hits the floor at any time it will turn red and the ball will be reset.
